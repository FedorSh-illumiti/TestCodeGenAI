		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Development Environment and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development environment setup into subtasks covering installation, project initialization, configuration, and testing setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard setup procedures for a CAP project with well-documented steps. The complexity is moderate due to the need to configure multiple tools (Node.js, TypeScript, Jest) and ensure they work together correctly. The steps are sequential and well-defined."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core Data Models and Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the data modeling task into subtasks for entity definition, relationship configuration, annotation implementation, sample data creation, and validation testing.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive data model with multiple related entities requires careful planning. The complexity comes from defining proper relationships between Travel, Booking, and BookingSupplement entities, implementing annotations, and ensuring data integrity across the model."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Travel Service with CRUD Operations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Travel Service implementation into subtasks for service definition, CRUD operations, validation logic, draft handling, error handling, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing business logic for CRUD operations with validation rules, draft handling, and error management. The complexity is higher because it requires understanding CAP service patterns and implementing proper validation logic for a core business entity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Service with Booking and Supplement Entities",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the service extension task into subtasks for Booking operations, BookingSupplement operations, price calculation logic, validation rules, deep operations, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need to implement nested entity operations with cascading effects. The price calculation logic that propagates changes across entity relationships adds significant complexity, as does implementing proper validation for interrelated entities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Master Data Services and Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the master data implementation into subtasks for service definition, value help configuration, validation rules, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple read-only entities with value help annotations. The complexity is moderate because the operations are simpler (mostly read-only), but there are multiple entities to configure and integration points with the main service."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Travel Processor Frontend Application",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the frontend development into subtasks for application generation, UI annotation configuration, custom sections implementation, action configuration, and responsive design implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a Fiori Elements application requires extensive annotation configuration and understanding of the UI generation patterns. The complexity comes from configuring proper navigation, implementing custom sections, and ensuring the UI correctly reflects the business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Analytics Service and Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analytics implementation into subtasks for analytical view definition, aggregation logic, KPI configuration, visualization implementation, and export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Analytics implementation requires complex data aggregation logic and visualization configuration. The task involves creating specialized analytical views, implementing calculation logic, and configuring visualizations, all of which require deep understanding of both the data model and analytics patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based Authorization and Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the authorization implementation into subtasks for role model definition, service handler authorization, status transition logic, approval workflow, audit trail, and security testing.",
			"reasoning": "Authorization and workflow implementation is highly complex due to the need to integrate security across all service operations. The four-tier role model with different permissions and the approval workflow add significant complexity, as does ensuring proper security for all operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Green Travel Initiative Features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Green Travel features into subtasks for entity extension, fee calculation logic, UI control implementation, and analytics integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves extending existing entities and implementing new calculation logic. The complexity is moderate because it builds on existing structures but requires implementing new business logic for environmental fee calculations and integrating with the analytics system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Production Deployment and HANA Migration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the production deployment configuration into subtasks for MTA configuration, HANA database setup, XSUAA integration, performance optimization, internationalization, and deployment automation.",
			"reasoning": "Production deployment involves multiple complex configurations across different systems. The complexity is high due to the need to configure cloud deployment, database migration, authentication integration, and performance optimizations, all of which require specialized knowledge."
