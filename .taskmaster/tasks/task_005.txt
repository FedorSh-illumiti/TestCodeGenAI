# Priority: medium
# Description: Create services for master data entities (Airlines, Passengers, TravelAgencies, etc.) and integrate them with the Travel service.
# Details:
1. Create srv/master-data-service.cds for master data entities

   - Airports
3. Implement value help annotations for UI integration
4. Create sample data for all master entities
5. Implement validation rules using master data (e.g., valid airport codes)
6. Add reference integrity checks between Travel entities and master data
7. Implement caching for frequently accessed master data
8. Configure proper sorting and filtering for value help dialogs

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all master data entities are accessible
2. Test value help functionality
3. Validate reference integrity with main entities
4. Test filtering and sorting capabilities
5. Verify sample data is correctly loaded
6. Test performance with larger datasets
7. Validate UI annotations for value helps
