# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Role-Based Authorization and Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the four-tier authorization model and implement approval workflows with status management.
# Details:
1. Define role model in xs-security.json:
   - authenticated-user: read-only access
   - reviewer: approval capabilities
   - processor: full operational access
   - admin: system configuration access
2. Implement role checks in service handlers:
   - READ restrictions based on roles
   - UPDATE/DELETE restrictions for processors/admins
   - Approval actions for reviewers
3. Configure status transitions with role validation:
   - Open → Accepted (requires reviewer role)
   - Accepted → Canceled (requires processor role)
4. Implement discount authorization workflow:
   - Add discount fields to Travel entity
   - Create approval process for discounts above threshold
   - Implement notification mechanism for pending approvals
5. Add audit trail through managed entity annotations
6. Configure secure handling of passenger information
7. Implement mock authentication for development
8. Prepare for XSUAA integration in production

# Test Strategy:
1. Test access control with different user roles
2. Verify status transitions with authorized/unauthorized users
3. Test approval workflow for discounts
4. Validate audit trail captures all changes
5. Test secure handling of passenger information
6. Verify authentication works in development mode
7. Test role-specific UI elements visibility
