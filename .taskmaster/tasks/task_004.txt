# Task ID: 4
# Title: Extend Service with Booking and Supplement Entities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the TravelService to include Booking and BookingSupplement entities with proper composition relationships and business logic.
# Details:
1. Update srv/travel-service.cds to expose Booking and BookingSupplement entities
2. Implement handlers for Booking operations in travel-service.js:
   - CREATE with validation and association to Travel
   - READ with expansion to flight data
   - UPDATE with price recalculation
   - DELETE with cascade handling
3. Implement BookingSupplement handlers:
   - CREATE with validation and price calculation
   - READ with supplement details
   - UPDATE with price impact on parent entities
   - DELETE with price recalculation
4. Implement automatic price calculation logic:
   - Update Travel.totalPrice when Bookings change
   - Update Booking.price when BookingSupplements change
5. Add validation for booking dates within travel dates
6. Configure deep insert/update operations
7. Implement proper error handling for nested operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test creation of Bookings within a Travel
2. Test creation of BookingSupplements within a Booking
3. Verify price calculations propagate correctly
4. Test validation rules for dates and relationships
5. Test deep read operations with expansions
6. Verify cascade delete behavior
7. Test error scenarios with invalid data
