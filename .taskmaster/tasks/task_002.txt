# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Core Data Models and Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the data models for Travel, Booking, BookingSupplement entities and master data with proper relationships and annotations.
# Details:
1. Create db/schema.cds file with the following entities:
   - Travel (root entity with UUID/sequential ID)
   - Booking (child entity with flight associations)
   - BookingSupplement (grandchild entity)
   - Master Data: Airlines, Passengers, TravelAgencies, Supplements, Flights, Airports
2. Define compositions between entities:
   - Travel to Booking (1:n)
   - Booking to BookingSupplement (1:n)
3. Add required fields for each entity:
   - Travel: ID, agencyID, customerID, beginDate, endDate, bookingFee, totalPrice, currencyCode, description, status, etc.
   - Booking: ID, travelID, flightDate, flightPrice, connectionID, etc.
   - BookingSupplement: ID, bookingID, supplementID, price, etc.
4. Add annotations for UI rendering and validation
5. Configure SQLite for development database
6. Create sample data in .csv files for initial deployment
7. Implement managed aspects for audit fields (createdAt, createdBy, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate schema using `cds compile db/schema.cds`
2. Deploy schema to SQLite using `cds deploy`
3. Verify entity relationships through CDS model inspection
4. Test data loading with sample CSV files
5. Validate field constraints and types
